### Abstract: 

Question Answering (QA) is a difficult problem to solve. Neural network models with memory and attention have made some strides in exhibiting reasoning capabilities required for QA. One such architecture, the Dynamic Memory Network (DMN) achieved high levels of accuracy on several language tasks. In this paper, we assess the extent to which the DMN can answer questions for a semi-closed QA domain i.e. predict if it is possible to answer a question in a given context after the machine has analyzed the question-context pair; and where an answer is possible, generate the answer to the question.
